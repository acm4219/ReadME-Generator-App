# Read Me Generator App

## Description
This app is used as a CLI for Node.js to craft a README.md File to describe a project or use for a markdown file.
## Usage
When accessing it in your terminal you answer the questions and add your license button to the end of the prompts. From there the information that you entered is transcribed to the README file and set up as a fully functional file. 
## Challenges
A big challenge for this was figuring out how to take the prompt answers from the inspect.json to make a README file. Luckily I was able to work with some classmates to figure out how that process came together and I was able to overcome it.
